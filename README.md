# Hello-World
The 1st

My name is...well that doesnt matter much. 

I am learning how to program on my own time throught the OSSC computer science course here in Github. Over the next two years i want to gain a better understanding about computer science and how coding can aid in my personal life. I also aspire to get my coding to a level where it is marketable. 

Cheers!
